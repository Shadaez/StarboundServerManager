StarboundServerManager
======================

Currently unrealeased! I'm polishing it up and the first version should be available before the newest patch is released.

Node.js program that starts a child process for the Starbound server and pushes useful data to a web page using Socket.io. Also allows starting and stopping of the server.

example:

Will add kicking, banning, etc, as the developers add the features into the base game.

To do:
- [ ] Add a first run config tool
- [ ] Find a more elegant way to shut the server down, to prevent data loss
- [ ] Clean up css
